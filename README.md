# Economics :chart_with_upwards_trend: :bar_chart:
This repository is a personal project to share with you my programs in R and Python about economic models or any relevant information to learn to manipulate economics data. You're free to clone and share the repository with anyone.

I'm happy that you're here. If you have any questions, advice, or comments, do not hesitate to contact me. Let's get started.

## Requirements :clipboard:
Essentially, you should know the basics of both languages to understand what I did. Regarding codes, for Python, you will have a text file called *requirements.txt* that you can use to install the necessary Python modules using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. For RStudio, you can use the syntax `install.packages("package_name")`.

## Folder organization :file_folder:
For our purpose, the folders are organized in an easy to review way. For this reason, you will find specific folders organization that follows the this structure:
* _Scripts_: Executable code files.
* _Data/inputs_: Data or information that feeds the executed projects.
* _Reports_: R Markdown and Jupyter Notebook are useful to visualize the codes and their results. Besides, both tools allow us to make the code documentation.
* _Outputs_: Results, forecasts, predictions, or any output from the project discussed.
* _Plots_: Graphics developed in the project.

The organization of the folders varies depending on the type of project developed. Additionally, there is an image with a conceptual map that summarizes the elaboration process.
