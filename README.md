# Economics :chart_with_upwards_trend: :bar_chart:
This repository is a personal project to share with the community pieces of code (R, Python, and MATLAB) about models or any relevant information to learn to manipulate economic data.

I'm happy that you're here. If you have any questions, advice, or comments, do not hesitate to contact me. Let's get started.

## Requirements :clipboard:
Essentially, you should know the basics of both languages to understand what I did. Regarding codes, for Python, you will have a text file called *requirements.txt* that you can use to install the necessary Python modules using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. For RStudio, you can use the syntax `install.packages("package_name")`.

## Folder organization :file_folder:
For our purpose, the folders are organized in an easy to review way. For this reason, you will find specific folders organization that follows the this structure:
* _Scripts_: Executable code files.
* _Data/inputs_: Data or information that feeds the executed projects.
* _Outputs_: Results, forecasts, predictions, or any output from the project discussed.
* _Plots_: Graphics developed in the project.

PD: The organization of the folders varies depending on the type of project developed. 

## Recommendations :pencil2:
I have some recommendations for you:
1. **Make sure you are familiar with both software:** You don't need to be an expert. But, you need to know at least the syntax and the basics of R and Python. THIS IS NOT AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE.
2. **Take into account the requirements:** The programs develop in this repository need the requirements to work. Make sure you have it check.
3. **Try to understand the code:** When you find functions, loops, or any command that you didn't know, please take a moment to understand it.
