# Economics :chart_with_upwards_trend: :bar_chart:
This repository is a personal project to share with you my programs in RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks about economic models or any relevant information to learn to manipulate economics data. You're free to clone and share the repository with anyone.

I'm happy that you're here. If you have any questions, advice, or comments, do not hesitate to contact me. Let's get started.

## Requirements :clipboard:
Essentially, you should know the basics of both languages to understand what I did. Regarding codes, for Jupyter Notebook, you will have a text file called *requirements.txt* that you can use to install the necessary Python modules using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. For RStudio, you can use the syntax `install.packages("package_name")`.

## Folder organization :file_folder:
For our purpose, the folder are organized in an easy to review way. In this reason, you will find specific folders organization that follows the following structure:
* _Scripts_: Executable code files (in the case of Python, the codes in .py are here).
* _Data/inputs_: Data or information that feeds the executed projects.
* _Notebooks (Only for Jupyter)_: Jupyter Notebook useful to visualize. 
* _Outputs_: Results, forecasts, predictions, or any output from the project discussed.
* _Plots_: Graphics developed in the project.

The organization of the folders varies depending on the type of project developed. Additionally, there is an image with a conceptual map that summarizes the elaboration process and a pdf file with the report of the code.

## Additional information :books:
In this section, you will find interesting links that you can review for free if you want to learn more about the topics covered in this project.
