# Economics :chart_with_upwards_trend: :bar_chart:
This repository is a personal project to share with you my programs in R and Python about economic models or any relevant information to learn to manipulate economics data. You're free to clone and share the repository with anyone.

I'm happy that you're here. If you have any questions, advice, or comments, do not hesitate to contact me. Let's get started.

## Requirements :clipboard:
Essentially, you should know the basics of both languages to understand what I did. Regarding codes, for Python, you will have a text file called *requirements.txt* that you can use to install the necessary Python modules using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. For RStudio, you can use the syntax `install.packages("package_name")`.

## Folder organization :file_folder:
For our purpose, the folders are organized in an easy to review way. For this reason, you will find specific folders organization that follows the this structure:
* _Scripts_: Executable code files.
* _Data/inputs_: Data or information that feeds the executed projects.
* _Reports_: R Markdown and Jupyter Notebook are useful to visualize the codes and their results. Besides, both tools allow us to make the code documentation.
* _Outputs_: Results, forecasts, predictions, or any output from the project discussed.
* _Plots_: Graphics developed in the project.

The organization of the folders varies depending on the type of project developed. Additionally, there is an image with a conceptual map that summarizes the elaboration process.

## Recommendations :pencil2:
I have some recommendations for you:
1. **Make sure you are familiar with both software:** You don't need to be an expert. But, you need to know at least the syntax and the basics of R and Python. THIS IS NOT AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE.
2. **Take into account the requirements:** The programs develop in this repository need the requirements to work. Make sure you have it check.
3. **Try to understand the code:** When you find functions, loops, or any command that you didn't know, please take a moment to understand it.
4. **Start with the "Report" folder:** If you are interested in seeing any of the projects, I recommend that you start with the "Reports" folder because it will show you what the code does, its purpose, and everything related to understanding what it does.
